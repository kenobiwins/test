# Completed Test Task - Tweets

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Functionality

- The application retrieves and displays a list of tweet users fetched from a backend API. Each tweet includes the user's tweets,followers, profile picture.


- Users can follow/unfollow other users by clicking the "Follow" button. The button text changes to "Following" when clicked, and the button color updates accordingly. The follower count increases by one for each follow action.


- The application persists the user's actions, such as following/unfollowing, even after page refresh. The "Following" state and the follower count remain intact. Clicking the "Follow" button again reverts the button text and color to the initial state. The follower count decreases by one.


## Additional Tasks

- Implemented pagination, displaying three tweets per page with the option to load more tweets.


- Implemented React Router to handle routing within the application, with the following routes.
